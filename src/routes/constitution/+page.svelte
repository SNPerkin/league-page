    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of players and draft picks (up to 3 drafts away) are allowed. Trades will process immediately and will be reversed if vetoed or under investigation for collusion. Tradable assets include players, draft picks, and FAAB $.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 80%</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 18 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids</li>
            <li>Third Offense – A league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>Any player traded from a team may not be re-acquired via trade within 6 weeks of the original trade. Any teams involved in this behavior will be subject to the aforementioned collusion punishments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.3 Trade Deadline</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>The trade deadline will be set for the Saturday of the week 11 games of the NFL season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFour}>1.2.4 Trade Restrictions</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>You will not be able to trade draft picks that are more than 3 drafts away. For example, during the 2023 season you cannot trade any picks in or after the 2027 draft. You may only trade FAAB $ from the current season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFive}>1.2.5 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 7 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a backup kicker). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>
    </div>    
    
    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>
    
    <p>FAAB Waiver wire system. Each team will begin each season with $100. $0 bids are allowed. Bids will process Wednesdays at 7AM GMT.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2 Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year will be a linear draft. The order will be assigned as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick x.01: Regular Season Standings - Team in 10th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.02: Regular Season Standings - Team in 9th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.03: Regular Season Standings - Team in 8th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.04: Regular Season Standings - Team in 7th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.05: Playoffs - 5th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.06: Playoffs - 6th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.07: Playoffs - 3rd place</li>
        <li>Pick x.08: Playoffs - 4th place</li>
        <li>Pick x.09: Playoffs - Winner</li>
        <li>Pick x.10: Playoffs - Runner-up</li>
    </ul>

    Note that draft orders via playoffs are to ensure that the 3rd and 5th place games have meaning to the teams involved (rather than rewarding the loser).

    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Rookie Drafts</h3>
    <p>Rookie drafts will consist of 5 round of drafting, with 8 hours alotted for each pick. To make room for the incoming players, each team will have a permanent 5 spot taxi squad (as of the end of season 1).</p>
    <p>Players will be allowed to stay on taxi squads for up to <b>2 years</b>.</p>
    <p>Taxi squads are locked at the start of the regular season, meaning that you can freely move players between your roster and taxi squad before the season starts. After the season begins, players can only be moved FROM your taxi squad to your roster (ONE WAY).
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>All drafts are slow drafts, so you have ample time to organise trades before and during your picks. The draft will not be paused for people to wheel and deal.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical  half-PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>
    <p>IDP scoring is based on a frankenstein of advice found on the net.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. The top 6 teams will recieve a playoff berth, with the top 2 getting a first round bye.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Points For</li>
        <li>Head 2 Head Record</li>
        <li>Total Points Against</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally roster few players of a position than required (e.g. all rosters must have 2+ QBs for gameweeks). Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty in order to improve your draft position may be subject to punishment, including but not limited to the forfeiture of draft selections.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged. Managers may choose to retire at any time.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisioner(s) will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Replacement Incentive</h3>
    <p>In the event that a manager chooses to quit the league or is removed by a comissioner, it'd be cool if they could help suggest a replacement.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>The league is free.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>There is no payout.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A clear majority vote (i.e. more than 6/10) is required in order to raise league dues.</p>
